Supports Multiple Paradigms: Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms, making it highly flexible for any task.

Anaconda and pip are two important tools in the Python ecosystem that are used for different purposes:

This  aims to simplify package management and deployment. Python agnostic, installs packages which may contain software written in any language.

Conda has the ability to create isolated environments that can contain different versions of Python and/or the packages installed in them.

pip (Pip Installs Packages): This is the standard package manager for Python. It can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other indexes.


In Python, a virtual environment is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worrying about affecting other projects.

conda create -n myenv python=3.9
conda create -n myenv python=3.2
